            <h1>We Happy.</h1>

            <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

            <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass mothercussin' house, cussin' up the way the cusser talks. Mothercusser do that cuss to me, he better paralyze my cuss, 'cause I'll kill the mothercusser, know what I'm sayin'?</p>

            <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that cuss? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that cuss.</p>

            <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullcuss about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that cuss in the kneecaps, find out where my cussin' money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, mothercusser. You listen: we go in there, and that cuss Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first mothercusser to get shot. You understand?</p>
